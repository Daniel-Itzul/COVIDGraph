# COVID19 Graph with Data from Open API
## Purpose
This is a little project that creates a comparitive graph of COVID19 cases leveraging the public API available in Postman.
It was intended to provide a comparitive of cases of COVID19 in Central America at a time that there was not such Graps provided by the governments in the region yet.
## Technology
This is very plain JavaScript implementation of the chart library that makes call to the COVID19 Postman API
## Status
The graphs is in working condition but I stoped working in this project due to limited time availability since:
1. Governments started to produce their own graphs
2. The data from governments that was used to feed the API was not 100% reliable anyway. 
This project help me to understand the concepts of promises in JS which comes very handy.
